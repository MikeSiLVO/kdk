    Lightweight structure matching Kodi's CGUIIncludes 5-map structure.

    This represents what Kodi loads at skin startup (eager loading):
    - Includes.xml -> build 5 maps (includes, defaults, constants, variables, expressions)
    - Font.xml -> fonts_defined
    - Builtin controls -> builtin_controls

    This is separate from the full ValidationIndex to enable lazy window validation.
    Windows are validated on-demand using these pre-built maps.
